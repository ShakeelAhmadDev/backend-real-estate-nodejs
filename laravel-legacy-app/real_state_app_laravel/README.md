## Real Estate Listings API - Laravel Mini-Task

This section details the Laravel mini-task for the Real Estate Listings API.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository (if not already done):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShakeelAhmadDev/backend-real-estate-nodejs
    cd real_state_app_laravel
    ```
2.  **Install Composer Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment File:**
    -   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (if it doesn't exist already):
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Generate an application key:
        ```bash
        php artisan key:generate
        ```
    -   **Update `.env` with your MySQL database credentials:**
        ```
        DB_CONNECTION=mysql
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_PORT=3306
        DB_DATABASE=real_estate_db
        DB_USERNAME=root
        DB_PASSWORD=password
        ```
        (Ensure your MySQL server is running and the `real_estate_db` database exists and is seeded with the provided `mashvisor_dump_db.sql`)

4.  **Run Migrations (optional, if database schema needs to be applied/updated):**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```
5.  **Start the Laravel Development Server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### API Endpoint

-   **GET `/laravel/listings`**
    -   Fetches all listings from the MySQL `real_estate_db` database.
    -   Returns data as JSON.
    -   Includes an additional field `"source": "laravel"` for each listing.
    -   The `city` field is returned with the first letter of each word capitalized.
    -   The `price` field is formatted to two decimal places.

### Choices and Decisions

-   **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**: Laravel's inherent MVC architecture was followed for structuring the application, creating a `Listing` model and `ListingController`.
-   **Eloquent ORM**: Utilized Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions, providing an expressive and easy-to-use interface for querying the `listings` table.
-   **JSON Response**: The API endpoint returns data in JSON format, which is a standard for RESTful APIs.
-   **Dedicated API Route**: The route was defined in `routes/api.php` to ensure it's prefixed with `/api` and to keep API-related routes separate from web routes.
-   **Hardcoded `source` field**: The `"source": "laravel"` field is directly added to each listing record in the controller method as per the requirements.

### Potential Improvements (if more time was available)

-   **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for database connection issues or data retrieval failures.
-   **Validation**: Add request validation for any potential future endpoints that might involve creating or updating listings.
-   **Pagination**: Implement pagination for the `/laravel/listings` endpoint to handle a large number of listings efficiently.
-   **API Resource Transformation**: Use Laravel API Resources for more flexible and powerful data transformation and serialization.
-   **Testing**: Write unit and feature tests for the `Listing` model and `ListingController` to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
